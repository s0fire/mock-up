## TeamsAppManifest.staticTabs property

A set of tabs that may be 'pinned' by default, without the user adding them manually. Static tabs declared in personal scope are always pinned to the app's personal experience. Static tabs do not currently support the 'teams' scope.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
staticTabs?: IStaticTab[];
```
