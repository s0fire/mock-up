## Resource Name Already Exists
### Error Message
* Website with given name xxx already exists.
* The storage account named xxx already exists under the subscription.
* The name 'xxx' already exists. Choose a different name.

### Mitigation
This error indicates the name for one or multiple Azure resources that going to be created already exists. The default name for all Azure resources is calculated based on the `resourceBaseName` parameter in `.fx/configs/azure.parameters.{envName}.json`. Please update the value of `resourceBaseName` to fix this error.

## Cannot move or create server. Subscription 'xxx' will exceed server quota.

### Mitigation

1. Delete other SQL server
1. Run `Teams: Provision in the cloud` command again

## The subscription registration is in 'Unregistered' state. The subscription must be registered to use namespace 'xxx'.

This error indicates your Azure account does not have required permission to register the namespace. There are two ways to mitigate this issue:
### Mitigation #1
Switch to an Azure account that has subscription level Contributor role.
### Mitigation #2
Ask your subscription administrator to register the namespace mentioned in the error message by following this [link](https://aka.ms/rps-not-found).

## Api service YOUR_APIM_INSTANCE_NAME was soft-deleted. In order to create the new service with the same name, you have to either undelete the service or purge it.

This error usually appears when you manually delete APIM service in your resource group and try to provision again.

APIM service implemented the [API Management soft delete feature](https://aka.ms/apimsoftdelete). In this feature, you can recover and restore recently deleted API Management (APIM) instances. If your APIM instance is not recovered within 48 hours, it will be hard deleted (unrecoverable).

If you are confident you would like to hard delete your service, execute the [purge API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/apimanagement/current-ga/deleted-services/purge) to delete the APIM instance permanently. Then re-provision resource with the same name.
