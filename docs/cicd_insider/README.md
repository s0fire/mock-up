## CI/CD Workflow Templates in GitHub
To include CI/CD workflows to automate Teams app development process in github, you need to:
1. Create a folder under `.github/workflows`
1. Copy the template files (either one or both of them):
    1. [github-ci-template.yml](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/main/docs/cicd_insider/github-ci-template.yml) for CI workflow.
    1.  [github-cd-template.yml](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/main/docs/cicd_insider/github-cd-template.yml) for CD workflow. 
1. Customize these workflows to fit your scenarios.

### Customize CI Workflow
There are some changes you can make to adapt the workflow for your project:

1. Change how the CI flow is triggered. We default to when a pull request is created targeting the `dev` branch.
1. Use a npm build script, or customize the way you build the project in the automation code.
1. Use a npm test script which returns zero for success, and/or change the test commands.

### Customize CD Workflow
You may want to change:
1. How the CD flow is triggered. By default it happens when new commits are made to the `main` branch.
1. Create GitHub [repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) by environment to hold Azure service principal and M365 account login credentials. The table below lists all the secrets you need to create on GitHub, and for detailed usage, please refer to the GitHub Actions [README.md](https://github.com/OfficeDev/teamsfx-cli-action/blob/main/README.md).
1. Change the build scripts if necessary.
1. Remove the test scripts if you don't have tests.

> Note: The provision step is not included in the CD template as it's usually executed only once. You can either execute provision Within Teams Toolkit, TeamsFx CLI, or using a seperated workflow. Please remember to commit after provisioning (results of provisioning will be deposited inside the `.fx` folder). 

### GitHub Secrets 
Steps to create secrets by environment in GitHub:
1. In the project `Settings` page, navigate to `Environments` section and click `New environment`.
1. Enter a name for your environment. The default environment name provided in the template is `test_environment`. Click `Configure environment` to proceed.
1. In the next page, click `Add Secret` to add secrets for each of the items listed in the table below.

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME|The service principal name of Azure used to provision resources.|
|AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_PASSWORD|The password of Azure service principal.|
|AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID|To identify the subscription in which the resources will be provisioned.|
|AZURE_TENANT_ID|To identify the tenant in which the subscription resides.|
|M365_ACCOUNT_NAME|The M365 account for creating and publishing the Teams App.|
|M365_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD|The password of the M365 account.|
|M365_TENANT_ID|To identify the tenant in which the Teams App will be created/published. This value is optional unless you have a multi-tenant account and you want to use another tenant. Read more on [how to find your M365 tenant ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-to-find-tenant).|
> Note: Currently, a non-interactive authentication style for M365 is used in CI/CD workflows, so please ensure that your M365 account has sufficient privileges in your tenant and doesn't have multi-factor authentication or other advanced security features enabled. Please refer to the [Configure M365 Credentials](https://github.com/OfficeDev/teamsfx-cli-action/blob/main/README.md#configure-m365azure-credentials-as-github-secret) to make sure you have disabled Multi-factor Authentication and Security Defaults for the credentials used in the workflow.

> Note: Currently, service principal for Azure is used in CI/CD workflows, and to create Azure service principals for use, refer to [here](#how-to-create-azure-service-principals-for-use).

## Setup CI/CD Pipelines with Azure DevOps

You can set up automated pipelines in Azure DevOps, and make a reference on the scripts and steps below to get started:
* [CI Scripts](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/main/docs/cicd_insider/others-script-ci-template.sh)
* [CD Scripts](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/main/docs/cicd_insider/others-script-cd-template.sh)

### Set up CI Pipeline
1. Add [CI Scripts](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/main/docs/cicd_insider/others-script-ci-template.sh) into your Azure DevOps repository, and do necessary customizations as you may infer from the comments in the script file.
1. Follow the [steps to create your Azure DevOps Pipeline for CI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/create-first-pipeline?view=azure-devops&tabs=java%2Ctfs-2018-2%2Cbrowser#create-your-first-pipeline-1). 

Here is an example of a common CI pipeline scripts:

```
trigger:
- dev 

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

steps:
- task: NodeTool@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '14.17.0'
    checkLatest: true
  
- task: Bash@3
  inputs:
    filePath: './others-script-ci-template.sh'
```

The potential changes you can make for the script or workflow definition:
1. Change how the CI flow is triggered. We default to when a new commit is pushed into the `dev` branch.
1. Change the way of how to install node and npm.
1. Use a npm build script, or customize the way you build in the automation code.
1. Use a npm test script which returns zero for success, and/or change the test commands.

### Set up CD Pipeline
1. Add [CD Scripts](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/main/docs/cicd_insider/others-script-cd-template.sh) into your Azure DevOps repository, and do necessary customizations as you may infer from the comments in the script file.
1. Create your Azure DevOps Pipeline for CD, as you may refer to [this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/create-first-pipeline?view=azure-devops&tabs=java%2Ctfs-2018-2%2Cbrowser#create-your-first-pipeline-1). The Pipeline's definition can be referred to the following example definition for CI Pipeline.
1. Add necessary variables by [Define variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml%2Cbatch), and make them as secrets if necessary.
```
trigger:
- main 

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

steps:
- task: NodeTool@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '14.17.0'
    checkLatest: true

- task: Bash@3
  env:
    SP_NAME: $(AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME)
    SP_PASSWORD: $(AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_PASSWORD)
    TENANT_ID: $(AZURE_TENANT_ID)
    AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: $(AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID)
    M365_ACCOUNT_NAME: $(M365_ACCOUNT_NAME)
    M365_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD: $(M365_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD)
  inputs:
    filePath: './others-script-cd-template.sh'
```

The potential changes you can make for the script or workflow definition:
1. How the CD flow is triggered. By default it happens when new commits are made to the `main` branch.
1. Change the way of how to install node and npm.
1. Change the environment name, by default it's `staging`.
1. Ensure you have a npm build script, or customize the way you build in the automation code.
1. Ensure you have a npm test script which returns zero for success, and/or change the test commands.

> Note: The provision step is not included in the CD template as it's usually executed only once. You can either execute provision Within Teams Toolkit, TeamsFx CLI, or using a seperated workflow. Please remember to commit after provisioning (results of provisioning will be deposited inside the `.fx` folder).

### Azure DevOps Pipeline Variables 
Steps to create Pipeline variables in Azure DevOps:
1. In the Pipeline editing page, click `Variables` on top right and click `New variable`.
1. Enter Name/Value pair for your variable.
1. Toggle the checkbox of `Keep this value secret` if necessary.
1. Click `OK` to create the variable. 

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME|The service principal name of Azure used to provision resources.|
|AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_PASSWORD|The password of Azure service principal.|
|AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID|To identify the subscription in which the resources will be provisioned.|
|AZURE_TENANT_ID|To identify the tenant in which the subscription resides.|
|M365_ACCOUNT_NAME|The M365 account for creating and publishing the Teams App.|
|M365_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD|The password of the M365 account.|
|M365_TENANT_ID|To identify the tenant in which the Teams App will be created/published. This value is optional unless you have a multi-tenant account and you want to use another tenant. Read more on [how to find your M365 tenant ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-to-find-tenant).|
> Note: Currently, a non-interactive authentication style for M365 is used in CI/CD workflows, so please ensure that your M365 account has sufficient privileges in your tenant and doesn't have multi-factor authentication or other advanced security features enabled. Please refer to the [Configure M365 Credentials](https://github.com/OfficeDev/teamsfx-cli-action/blob/main/README.md#configure-m365azure-credentials-as-github-secret) to make sure you have disabled Multi-factor Authentication and Security Defaults for the credentials used in the workflow.

> Note: Currently, service principal for Azure is used in CI/CD workflows, and to create Azure service principals for use, refer to [here](#how-to-create-azure-service-principals-for-use).

## CI/CD Pipeline Templates in Jenkins

To add these templates to your repository, you will need your versions of [jenkins-ci-template.Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/main/docs/cicd_insider/jenkins-ci-template.Jenkinsfile) and  [jenkins-cd-template.Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/main/docs/cicd_insider/jenkins-cd-template.Jenkinsfile) to be located in your repository by branch.

Also, you need to create CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins which point to the specific `Jenkinsfile` correspondingly.

To check how to connect Jenkins with different SCM platforms:
1. [Jenkins with GitHub](https://www.jenkins.io/solutions/github/)
2. [Jenkins with Azure DevOps](https://www.dragonspears.com/blog/ci-cd-with-jenkins-and-azure-devops-services)
3. [Jenkins with GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/jenkins.html)
4. [Jenkins with Bitbucket](https://medium.com/ampersand-academy/integrate-bitbucket-jenkins-c6e51103d0fe)

### Customize CI Pipeline
There are some potential changes you can make to adapt your project:

1. Rename the template file to `Jenkinsfile` since it's a common practice, and put it under the target branch, for example, the `dev` branch.
1. Change how the CI flow is triggered. We default to use the triggers of `pollSCM` when a new change is pushed into the `dev` branch.
1. Ensure you have a npm build script, or customize the way you build in the automation code.
1. Ensure you have a npm test script which returns zero for success, and/or change the test commands.

### Customize CD Pipeline
You may want to change:
1. Rename the template file to `Jenkinsfile` since it's a common practise, and put it under the target branch, for example, the `main` branch.
1. How the CD flow is triggered. We default to use the triggers of `pollSCM` when a new change is pushed into the `main` branch.
1. Create Jenkins [pipeline credentials](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/using-credentials/) to hold Azure service principal and M365 account login credentials. The table below lists all the credentials you need to create on Jenkins.
1. Change the build scripts if necessary.
1. Remove the test scripts if you don't have tests.

> Note: The provision step is not included in the CD template as it's usually executed only once. You can either execute provision Within Teams Toolkit, TeamsFx CLI, or using a seperated workflow. Please remember to commit after provisioning (results of provisioning will be deposited inside the `.fx` folder). 

### Jenkins Credentials 
Please follow [using-credentials](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/using-credentials/) to create credentials on Jenkins.

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME|The service principal name of Azure used to provision resources.|
|AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_PASSWORD|The password of Azure service principal.|
|AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID|To identify the subscription in which the resources will be provisioned.|
|AZURE_TENANT_ID|To identify the tenant in which the subscription resides.|
|M365_ACCOUNT_NAME|The M365 account for creating and publishing the Teams App.|
|M365_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD|The password of the M365 account.|

## Getting started guide for other platforms
You can follow the pre-defined example bash scripts to build and customize CI/CD pipelines on other platforms:
* [CI Scripts](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/main/docs/cicd_insider/others-script-ci-template.sh)
* [CD Scripts](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/main/docs/cicd_insider/others-script-cd-template.sh)
The scripts are pretty straightforward and most parts of them are cross-platform CLI, so it's easy to transform them to other types of script, for example, powershell.

The scripts are based on a cross-platform TeamsFx command line tool [TeamsFx-CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/teamsfx-cli). You can install it with `npm install -g @microsoft/teamsfx-cli` and follow the [documentation](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/dev/docs/cli/user-manual.md) to customize the scripts.

> Note: To enable M365 account login by non-interactive mode, turn on `CI_ENABLED` by `export CI_ENABLED=true`.

> Note: To enable `@microsoft/teamsfx-cli` running in non-interactive mode, set a global config like below:
```
teamsfx config set -g interactive false
```
In non-interactive mode, `@microsoft/teamsfx-cli` will not ask questions for inputs interactively. And, if you'd like to use non-interactive mode by command, please add an option `--interactive false` by command.

Please keep in mind that you must store Azure and M365 credentials in your environment variables securely. For example if you are using Github as your source code repository, you can use the [Github Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) to securely store your credentials.

The following table gives details about the required environment variables used in the script.

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME|The service principal name of Azure used to provision resources.|
|AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_PASSWORD|The password of Azure service principal.|
|AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID|To identify the subscription in which the resources will be provisioned.|
|AZURE_TENANT_ID|To identify the tenant in which the subscription resides.|
|M365_ACCOUNT_NAME|The M365 account for creating and publishing the Teams App.|
|M365_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD|The password of the M365 account.|
|M365_TENANT_ID|To identify the tenant in which the Teams App will be created/published. This value is optional unless you have a multi-tenant account and you want to use another tenant. Read more on [how to find your M365 tenant ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-to-find-tenant).|
> Note: Currently, a non-interactive authentication style for M365 is used in CI/CD workflows, so please ensure that your M365 account has sufficient privileges in your tenant and doesn't have multi-factor authentication or other advanced security features enabled. Please refer to the [Configure M365 Credentials](https://github.com/OfficeDev/teamsfx-cli-action/blob/main/README.md#configure-m365azure-credentials-as-github-secret) to make sure you have disabled Multi-factor Authentication and Security Defaults for the credentials used in the workflow.

> Note: Currently, service principal for Azure is used in CI/CD workflows, and to create Azure service principals for use, refer to [here](#how-to-create-azure-service-principals-for-use).

# How to create Azure service principals for use?
To provision and deploy resources targeting Azure inside CI/CD, you must create an Azure service principal for use.

Briefly, the steps include:
1. Register an Azure AD application in single tenant, and it requires sufficient permissions in your Azure AD tenant.
2. Assign a role to your Azure AD application to access your Azure subscription, and `Contributor` role is recommended. 
3. Create a new Azure AD application secret.
4. Grab your tenant id, application id(AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME), and the secret(AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_PASSWORD) for use.

For detailed guidelines, refer to [the official document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal). There're three ways to create service principal, [Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal), [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-authenticate-service-principal-powershell), [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli), and you can choose the way you like.

# How to publish Teams app using Developer Portal for Teams? 
If there's any changes related to Teams app's manifest file, you may want to publish the Teams app again to update the manifest.

To publish Teams app manually, you may leverage [Developer Portal for Teams](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/home).

Steps:
1. Sign in [Developer Portal for Teams](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com) using the corresponding account.
2. Import your app package in zip by clicking `App -> Import app -> Replace`.
3. Click the target app in app list, and you will go to the overview page.
4. Publish your app by clicking `Publish -> Publish to your org`
