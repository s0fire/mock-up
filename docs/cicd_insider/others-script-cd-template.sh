# After provisioning, you should commit necessary files under .fx into the repository.

# Provision hosting environment.

# Commit provision configs if necessary.
# git add .fx
# git commit -m "chore: commit provision configs"

# Deploy to hosting environment.
npx teamsfx deploy --env ${TEAMSFX_ENV_NAME}

# This step is to pack the Teams App as zip file,
# which can be used to be uploaded onto Teams Client for installation.
# Build Teams App's Package.
npx teamsfx package --env ${TEAMSFX_ENV_NAME}

# Upload Teams App's Package as artifacts.
# Choose what your workflow/pipeline platform provided to
# upload build/appPackage/appPackage.staging.zip as artifacts.

# Publish Teams App.
