# Teams Toolkit v5.0 Pre-release

### What does pre-release mean?
Pre-release is meant for those who are eager to try the latest Teams Toolkit features and fixes. Even though pre-releases are not intended for use in production, they are at a sufficient quality level for you to generally use and [provide feedback](https://aka.ms/ttk-feedback). However, pre-release versions can and probably will change, and those changes could be major.

We've addressed a number of reported bugs and added major changes in this release based on your feedback to make Teams Toolkit more flexible. Some of the key highlights to these changes include:

- Use existing infrastructure, resource groups, and more when provisioning
- Use an existing Teams app ID
- Use an existing Azure AD app registration ID
- Use a different tunneling solution or customize the defaults
- Add custom steps to debugging, provisioning, deploying, publishing, etc.

### What about my existing Teams Toolkit projects?
The changes in this pre-release require upgrades to the TeamsFx configuration files. We recommend that you create a new app using this version. In the future, we'll provide a way to automatically upgrade existing Teams apps that were created with a previous version of Teams Toolkit.

# Personal tab across Microsoft 365

Personal tabs provide a great way to enhance the Microsoft Teams experience. Using personal tabs, you can provide a user access to their application right within Teams, without the user having to leave the experience or sign in again. Now, personal tabs can light up within other Microsoft 365 applications. You can build and run your personal tabs in Teams, both Outlook desktop and web experiences, and also the Microsoft 365 app on the web.
