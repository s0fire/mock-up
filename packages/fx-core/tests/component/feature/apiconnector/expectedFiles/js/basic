// This file is auto generated by Teams Toolkit to provide you instructions and reference code to call your API.

Next steps:
1. Run npm install. We added the @microsoft/teamsfx to your package.json.
   You need to run the command under the "bot" folder (instead of your project root folder).
2. Add your user password to TEAMSFX_API_FAKE_PASSWORD in `bot/.env.teamsfx.local`.

It is also recommended to put all the configurations into config.js file.

You can import the API client (an Axios instance) in another file and call fake APIs and authentication is now handled for you automatically.

Here is an example for a GET request to "relative_path_of_target_api":
```
const { fakeClient } = require("relative_path_to_this_file");

const response = await fakeClient.get("relative_path_of_target_api");
// You only need to enter the relative path for your API.
// For example, if you want to call api https://my-api-endpoint/test and you configured https://my-api-endpoint as the API endpoint,
// your code will be: const response = await fakeClient.get("test");

const responseBody = response.data;
```

If you added this API while local debugging, stop local debugging and start again because local debugging will not hot reload changes to `.env.teamsfx.local`.
